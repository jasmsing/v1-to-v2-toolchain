template.description: "A toolchain is an open, extensible system of tools that supports the development, deployment, and operations of an application.\n\n#### About the Upgrade Process\nWhen you create this toolchain, it is preconfigured with IBM hosted Git for source control, Delivery Pipeline for building and deployment, and the Eclipse Orion Web IDE for code editing. You can add more tools to the toolchain as needed. To get started, click **Create**.\n\n#### More Info\n[Tutorial: Upgrade your project to a toolchain](https://ibm.biz/ids-upgrade-blogpost)\n\n[Docs: Getting started with Continuous Delivery](https://console.ng.bluemix.net/docs/services/ContinuousDelivery/index.html)\n\n[Blog: Bluemix Continuous Delivery](https://www.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/2016/11/bluemix-continuous-delivery-is-now-live/)~otc-ui1750"
template.gettingStarted: "This toolchain was created from your [DevOps Services project]({[{projectUrl}]}). Migration of artifacts from the project to the tools in the toolchain continues for a while after the toolchain is created. Before you use the toolchain, verify the status of the upgrade by reviewing the banner on the [project page]({[{projectUrl}]}), then refer to [these steps](https://console.ng.bluemix.net/docs/services/ContinuousDelivery/upgrade_projects.html#upgrade_next_steps) for what to do next.
